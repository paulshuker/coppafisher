# Find Spots

Spots are detected as local intensity maxima on the filtered images to create 3D point clouds. Spot positions are used 
later in [register](register.md) and [call spots](call_spots.md).

## 0: Auto Threshold

For each tile ($t$)/round ($r$)/channel ($c$) image, an automatic intensity threshold (shortened to `auto_thresh`) is 
computed. This is done by taking all pixels on a single, central z plane on the filtered image called $I_{xy}$. The 
`auto_thresh` is 

$$
\text{auto\_thresh}_{trc} = \text{median}(|I|_{trcxy})_{trc..} \times a
$$

where $|...|$ is the absolute value of each element separately. The median is computed over all x and y values to give 
a scalar that is a good lower bound estimate for the random noise amplitude. $a$ is the `auto_thresh_multiplier` 
(typically $20$). The higher `auto_thresh_multiplier` is, the stricter the find spots algorithm is. If the computed 
`auto_thresh` is zero, then it is set to `auto_thresh_multiplier`.

## 1: Spot Detection

For each tile/round/channel filtered image ($I_{trcxyz}$), a 3D point cloud is created out of all points where 

$$
I_{trcxyz} > \text{auto\_thresh}_{trc}
$$

## 2: Remove Duplicates

Some of these points will be nearby or adjacent, representing the same spot multiple times. To deal with this, points 
are removed. For each point, an ellipsoid region of x/y radius `radius_xy` (typically $5$) and z radius `radius_z` 
(typically $2$) is considered. If one or more points are found within the point's ellipsoid region, then only the point 
with the greatest intensity is kept. If a point is isolated, it is kept. The process is repeated for all points.

If too few spots are found for a tile/round/channel image, then a warning and/or error is raised to the user.

## 3: Spot Culling

On sequencing rounds/channels, it is not important to capture every spot detection. But, the spots must be of high 
quality and about evenly distributed along the z planes for [registration](register.md). So, if there are too many 
spots detected, only the most intense spots are kept for each z plane. The maximum number of spots kept for each z 
plane is 

$$
\frac{\text{max\_spots\_percent} \times L_{xy}^2}{100}
$$

where $L_{xy}$ is the number of pixels along the x (y) axis for a single tile. `max_spots_percent` (typically $0.0094$) 
is a config parameter.

## Diagnostics

### Auto Threshold

The calculated auto thresholds can be seen from the notebook. For tile `t`, round `r`, channel `c`, the `auto_thresh` 
value is saved as `float32` at

```python
from coppafish import Notebook

nb = Notebook("/path/to/notebook")
nb.find_spots.auto_thresh[t, r, c]
```

### Detected Spots

A find spots viewer will help to understand the config parameters. Move sliders to adjust the find spots parameters and 
see the spot detection results. You can select any tile/round/channel combination. By default, the first tile's anchor 
round/channel is shown. To display the viewer, create a Python script with the following code and call it 
`find_spots_plot.py`:

```python
from coppafish import Notebook
from coppafish.plot import view_find_spots

if __name__ == "__main__":
    nb = Notebook("/path/to/notebook")
    view_find_spots(nb)
```

Run the script from your coppafish environment

```shell
python find_spots_plot.py
```

Open the [link](http://127.0.0.1:8050/) shown in the terminal on a modern browser to show and interact with the viewer. 
Press Ctrl + C when in the terminal to close the viewer.

Spot detection is most crucial for the anchor round/channel images. So, it is recommended to configure find spots 
parameters based on one of these images.
