## Algorithm

Coppafisher is built on the principle: An algorithm that performs well does not need to be changed. So, algorithms are
only updated when there is evidence that it can perform better and that the current algorithm is performing worse.

## Installation

We use a protected staging branch called `dev`, for a future release. This must be pull requested into and pass
continuous integration tests. The `main` branch is pushed into from `dev` to publish a new release. `main` is always the
latest stable release for users to easily install the software.

While changing code, [install](index.md#installation) coppafisher as usual but keep the downloaded local source code
directory. Then install dev packages

??? note "Local Code Location"

    Avoid cloning coppafisher inside a subdirectory named `coppafisher` because this could cause strange errors to
    occur.

```terminal
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Also, put coppafisher into editable mode while changing source code

```terminal
pip install -e .
```

Now all local code changes immediately take affect.

## Pre-Commit

[Pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) hooks will automatically run on every git commit. This will
ensure files are consistently formatted and checked. It also runs linting rules through
[ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff). Use pre-commit hooks by

```terminal
pre-commit install
```

You can run pre-commit checks manually as well:

```terminal
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Auto-update pre-commits (recommended):

```terminal
pre-commit autoupdate
```

If a commit is pushed that fails a pre-commit hook, then the GitHub integration workflow will catch it.

## Tests

Tests are run via [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/). Scripts are unit tested by placing the test scripts
inside a directory called `test` within the script's directory. All test script file names should start with `test_`.
The scripts must end with their relative directory (directories) and their script file name, separated by underscores.
For example, the test script for `coppafisher/omp/coefs.py` is named `test_omp_coefs.py`. Check existing tests for
examples.

## Run Tests

Run unit tests (~10s)

```terminal
pytest
```

Run integration tests (~90s)

```terminal
pytest -m integration
```

Run unit tests requiring a notebook (~20s)

```terminal
pytest -m notebook
```

View code coverage by appending `--cov=coppafisher --cov-report term` to each command.

## Run Documentation Locally

```terminal
mkdocs serve
```

Then go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) in a modern browser.

## Code Philosophy

We follow basic rules when coding. Anyone can code something that works, but coding it in a scaleable, maintainable way
is another struggle altogether.

Here are some specific standards to follow:

* Knowledge written down twice is bad code. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)!
* If a bug is found, the bug must be automatically found if it is to occur again.
* All code is [black](https://github.com/psf/black) formatted.
* Every time a function is modified or created, a new unit test must be created for the function. A pre-existing unit
test can be drawn from to build a new unit test, but it should be clear in your mind that you are affectively building a
new function.
* Minimise `#!python if`/`#!python else` branching as much as possible. Exit `#!python if`/`#!python else` nesting as
soon as possible through the use of keywords like `#!python raise`, `#!python continue`, `#!python break` and
`#!python return`, whenever feasible.
* Do not over-shorten a variable or function name.
* Variables and functions are not capitalised, classes are.
* In most cases, a line of code should do only one operation.
* Every docstring for a function must be complete so a developer can re-create the function without seeing any of the
existing source code.
* Each parameter in a function must have an independent, clear functionality. If two parameters are derivable from one
another, you are doing something wrong. This also applies to the function's return variables.
* Minimise the number of data types a parameter can be and use common sense. For example, a parameter that can be
`#!python int` or `#!python None` is reasonable. A parameter that can be `#!python bool` or `#!python float` is not
reasonable.
* The documentation should update in parallel with the code. Having the documentation as part of the github repository
makes this easier.

## Docstrings

While not all docstrings are consistent yet, future docstrings follow the rules below:

* The code must be reproducible from the docstring alone.
* Use [Google's style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
* `` `ndarray` `` represents a numpy ndarray and `` `zarray` `` represents a zarr Array.
* `` `zgroup` `` represents a zarr Group.
* Specify datatype of a `ndarray`/`zarray` when applicable. For example, to represent any floating point datatype,
`` `ndarray[float]` `` or a uint16 by `` `ndarray[uint16]` ``
* Specify the shape of a `ndarray`/`zarray` in brackets when applicable. For example,
`` `(n_tiles x n_rounds x n_channels_use x 3) ndarray[int32]` ``
* The use of `n_rounds` refers to the number of rounds, including the sequencing and anchor round. So, this is equal to
`n_seq_rounds + 1`. We label all sequencing rounds `0, 1, 2, 3, ...` and then the anchor round is given the next unused
integer. Whereas, `n_rounds_use` refers to `#!py len(use_rounds)` which is the total number of sequencing rounds.
* Channels are slightly different because `use_channels` in the notebook can have channel indices of any positive
integer value. These represent the sequencing channels. For example, `use_channels = 0, 5, ..., 27`. So, `n_channels`
refers to size `#!py max(use_channels) + 1`, i.e. the smallest shape that can be indexed by `use_channels`. Whereas,
`n_channels_use` means `#!py len(use_channels)` such that `0` represents `#!py use_channels[0]` etc. Note that neither
of these definitions includes the dapi channel/anchor channel[^1], which can be found at
`#!py nb.basic_info.dapi_channel` and `#!py nb.basic_info.anchor_channel` respectively.

Below is a docstring example that demonstrates most of the rules.

```py
--8<-- "docstring_example.py"
```

[^1]:
    The anchor channel can be a sequencing channel, but this does not have to be the case.
