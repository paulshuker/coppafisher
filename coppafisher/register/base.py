    Function to carry out optical flow registration on a single tile and round.

    Optical flow is computed using an iterative Lucas-Kanade method with 10 iterations and a window radius specified

    as a dot product between the base and target images within a small window of each pixel.

            (Note that this is the radius on the downsampled image, so a radius of 5 with a downsample factor of 4 will
             correspond to a radius of 20 on the original image). Default: 5
