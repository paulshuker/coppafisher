        Compute OMP pixel scores on the given pixel colours.

        First, the all negative signal in pixel_colours is set to 0. At each iteration of OMP, the next best gene
        assignment is found from the residual spot colours. A pixel is stopped iterating on if gene assignment fails.
        See function `get_next_gene_assignments` below for details on the stopping criteria and gene scoring. Pixels
        that do not fail are weighted and a new pixel score is added to the final pixel scores. Pixels that are gene
        assigned are then fitted with the additional gene to find updated pixel scores. See function
        `get_gene_pixel_scores` for details on the pixel score computation.

        Args:
            pixel_colours (`(n_pixels x n_rounds_use x n_channels_use) ndarray[float]`): pixel intensity in each
                sequencing round and channel.
            bled_codes (`(n_genes x n_rounds_use x n_channels_use) ndarray[float32]`): every gene bled code. Each gene
                must be L2 normalised over all rounds and channels.
            background_codes (`(n_channels_use x n_rounds_use x n_channels_use) tensor[float]`): the background bled
                codes. These are simply uniform brightness in one channel for all rounds. background_codes[0] is the
                first code, background_codes[1] is the second code, etc.
            maximum_iterations (int): the maximum number of gene assignments allowed for one pixel.
            dot_product_threshold (float): a gene must have a dot product score above this value on the residual spot
                colour to be assigned the gene. If more than one gene is above this threshold, the top score is used.
            minimum_intensity (float): a pixel's residual intensity must be above minimum_intensity to pass gene
                assignment.
            alpha (float): the alpha parameter. Used to compute the error variance after each iteration.
            beta (float): the beta parameter. Used to compute the error variance after each iteration.
            return_all_scores (bool, optional): return all gene round dot product scores on each iteration. Default:
                false.
            return_all_weights (bool, optional): return all gene bled code weights for every gene that was assigned.
                This only works for when n_pixels is 1. Default: false.
            return_all_residuals (bool, optional): return all residual colours used to compute the final pixel scores.
                Default: false.
            force_cpu (bool, optional): only use the CPU to solve. Default: true.

        Returns:
            Tuple (tensor if only one tensor is returned) containing the following:
                - (`(n_pixels x n_genes) ndarray[float32]`): pixel_scores. Each gene's final pixel score for every
                    pixel.
                - (`((n_iterations + 1) x n_pixels x n_genes_all) ndarray[float32]`): dp_scores. The dot product
                    score for every gene on each iteration. This even includes the iteration that did not assign any new
                    genes so you can see what the final gene scores were before stopping. Only returned if
                    return_dp_scores is true.
                - (`(n_pixels x n_genes) ndarray[float32]`): gene_weights. The gene weights given to each gene on all
                    pixels on their final iteration. For genes that were not assigned on a pixel, nan is placed. Only
                    returned if return_all_weights is true.
                - (`(n_pixels x n_genes x n_rounds_use x n_channels_use) ndarray[float32]`): final_residuals. For every
                    gene, this is the residual colour that is scored against the gene's bled code to find the final
                    pixel scores. In the OMP method documentation, this is denoted by epsilon ^ 2 * tilde{R} with i
                    being the final iteration. For genes that are not assigned to a pixel, nan is placed. Only returned
                    if return_all_residuals is true.

        Notes:
            - All computations are run with 32-bit float precision.
            - The boolean flags are only used in OMP subplots to gather additional insight, they do not affect the final
                  pixel score results.
