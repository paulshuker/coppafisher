    """
    Compare two collections of spots and assign each spot in the 0 collection either true positive, wrong positive,
    false positive. If a spot in collection 0 is matched to a spot in collection 1 if close together and of the same
    gene index, then this spot is a true positive. Any remaining spots are matched to close together spots in collection
    1 also left unmatched and assigned as wrong positives. Remaining spots in collection 0 are false positives. If there
    are still unassigned spots in collection 1, these add to the false negative count. When multiple matches are found,
    the matched spots are the ones appearing first in the arrays for deterministic results. Collection 1 acts as the
    ground truth dataset.

    Args:
        spot_positions_0 (`(n_spots_0 x 3) ndarray[float]`): spot collection 0 positions. spot_positions_0[i] is the ith
            spot's y, x, and z position.
        spot_gene_indices_0 (`(n_spots_0) ndarray[int]`): spot gene indices.
        spot_positions_1 (`(n_spots_1 x 3) ndarray[float]`): spot collection 1 positions.
        spot_gene_indices_1 (`(n_spots_1) ndarray[int]`): spot collection 1 gene indices.
        distance_threshold (float): spot's are matched if their distance is no greater than distance_threshold.

    Returns:
        - spot_assignments (`(n_spots_0) ndarray[int8]): each collection 0 spot is given a label. 0 represents a true
            positive, 1 represents a wrong positive, 2 represents a false positive.
        - n_false_negatives (int): the number of false negative spots.
